No"¿If a class was private... who could use it? For a normal, top-level class, the only access modifiers that make sense are public and default (package). Only nested inner classes can be private.
ö-Can a top-level class be marked as protected?
Yes
No"◊A top-level class can ONLY be marked public or default (package). The protected access is just for member variables and methods, and allows subclasses outside the superclass package to inherit the protected members.

You get 270 >> 1"ÂShifting bits by a number greater than or equal to the number of bits in the result (eg. 32 bits for an int) will cause the value to be shifted by the number modulo the number of bits in the value (you shift by 33%32 which is 1).
